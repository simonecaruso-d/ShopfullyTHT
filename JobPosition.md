We’re a team of 450 people (and counting!), from 30 different nationalities. We’re on a mission to innovate, and we believe the key to that is seeing the world through a variety of perspectives. That’s why building a more diverse team, as well as bringing in even more talent, is so important for us.



**TO FEEL AT HOME 🛋️ IN SHOPFULLY YOU NEED**

* Progress Over Perfection: We move forward. Always. In a fast-moving world, speed with purpose beats certainty without action. Momentum matters—not for its own sake, but because it drives results.
* Clarity Through Transparency: We bring each other along. We work in teams, not silos. Transparency gives context, and context enables action. That means we share decisions early, publish work in progress, and document outcomes so others can learn, move faster, and build better.
* Learn Loudly: We grow by doing and by daring. Big bets unlock big breakthroughs. But real innovation demands risk, and risk always carries the possibility of failure. That’s not a flaw. It’s the price of ambition.
* Challenge with Empathy: We speak up, even when it’s hard—because candor shows care, and leads to better outcomes. Listening deeply is how we grow. Disagreeing openly is how we build trust.
* Always Build Better: We are builders—of products, systems, and ideas. But more than that, we are builders of better. Better has no finish line. It’s a mindset.
